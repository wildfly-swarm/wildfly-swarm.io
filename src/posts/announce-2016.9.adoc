== It's September, so that means 2016.9 is out!

Continuing our trend of monthly releases, as discussed on
the https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/wildfly-swarm/c7X3Rfjng6Q[Google Group], 
we're pleased to release 2016.9, celebrating September, a month never
mentioned by Shakespeare in any of his plays.

=== What's New?

* WildFly 10.1.0.Final
* Continued MicroProfile support
* Cleaner WEB-INF/lib
* Hollow Uberjars

=== What is WildFly Swarm?

WildFly Swarm is the decomposition and reconstitution of the popular
http://www.wildfly.org[WildFly Java Application Server] in order to support _just enough appserver_
for microservice type applications.

Each portion of the appserver is referred to as a _fraction_, which many times
maps to a `subsystem` from WildFly, but also may include other discrete chunks
of non-Java EE or WIldFly functionality, such as _Swagger_, _Jolokia_ or _NetflixOSS Ribbon_.

=== WildFly 10.1.0.Final 

This release of WildFly Swarm is now based upon WildFly 10.1.0.Final,
which brings about easy support for HTTP2, among other interesting things.


=== MicroProfile

While we added support for MicroProfile last month, this month we provide
a handy-dandy, downloadble server for your existing MicroProfile-complaint
`.war` applications.  You can link:/download/microprofile-hollowswarm[grab it]
and https://wildfly-swarm.gitbooks.io/wildfly-swarm-users-guide/content/v/2016.9/server/microprofile.html[read about how to use it].

=== Cleaner `WEB-INF/lib`

A chronic problem we've seen in the past is that various usage scenarios
result in extraneous items appearing in your `WEB-INF/lib` directory. This
not only caused bloat, but also could cause errors, particularly regarding CDI.

The Maven plugin now will be smarter about what goes into `WEB-INF/lib`, and
actively repackages your `.war` file to ensure that it isn't polluted, in
the case of `compile` scoped transitive dependencies.

=== Hollow Uberjars

This release supports the concept of _hollow_ uberjars, which is a slightly
contradictory term, of course.  You can perform a build with the property
of `swarm.hollow` set to true, and the resulting uberjar will be capable
of running your application.  But it won't actually contain your application.

This is differentiated by the `-hollowswarm.jar` suffix on the resulting output.

This is the mechanism we used to provide the MicroProfile server mentioned above,
but it's possibly useful for your own purposes.  Simply pass your own `.war`
files for deployment on the command-line.  If you're using Linux containers, such
as Docker, this would allow you to put just enough app-server on one layer, while
stuffing your application `.war` on a higher one.

=== Bugfixes

There are quite a few bugs fixed in this release since 2016.8.1.
