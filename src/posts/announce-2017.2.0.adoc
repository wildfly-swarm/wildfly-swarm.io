== Announcing our lovingly produced release for Valentine's!

To spread the love for Valentine's Day, we're happy to announce
version 2017.2.0 of WildFly Swarm!

=== What's New?

* New docs and config visibility
* `@DefaultDeployment` defaults to WAR
* Fraction auto detection for Arquillian
* Security Constraints in Yaml
* Update to Keycloak 2.5.0.Final

=== What is WildFly Swarm?

WildFly Swarm is the decomposition and reconstitution of the popular
http://www.wildfly.org[WildFly Java Application Server] in order to support _just enough appserver_
for microservice type applications.

Each portion of the appserver is referred to as a _fraction_, which many times
maps to a `subsystem` from WildFly, but also may include other discrete chunks
of non-Java EE or WildFly functionality, such as _Swagger_, or _Jolokia_.

== New docs and config visibility

We've officially released our link:/howto/2017-2-0[How To's] and new link:/refguide/2017-2-0[Reference Guide]!

They both might be a little sparse right now, but we will be working hard to
fill them with valuable information to make it even easier to develop with WildFly Swarm!

If you have ideas about what should be there, particularly for the link:/howto/2017-2-0[How To's],
then please get in touch and let us know.

Along with the configuration being present in the link:/refguide/2017-2-0[Reference Guide] for each fraction,
you can now see what configuration is available for your particular uber jar with:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar myapp-swarm.jar --help
----

== `@DefaultDeployment` defaults to WAR

Previously when annotating an Arquillian test with `@DefaultDeployment` it would default to
creating a JAR for your test deployment.

After feedback from the community we've switched the default to be WAR,
which is the far larger use case for our community.

So, be warned that if you have a test with `@DefaultDeployment` without setting the type,
it will now create a WAR instead of a JAR.

== Fraction auto detection for Arquillian

Previously there was no way for Arquillian to perform auto detection as part of running a test,
which wasn't great for projects that relied on the plugin doing that as part of a build.

We've now modified our Arquillian process to perform the same auto detection that the
plugin does when there are no explicit dependencies present in your project.
Making it possible to test a project relying on auto detection as part of its build.

== Security Constraints in Yaml

It's now possible define your endpoint security within `project-defaults.yml` directly:

[source,yaml]
----
  swarm.keycloak.security-constraints:
    - url-pattern: /endpoint
      methods: [GET, POST]
      roles: [admin]
