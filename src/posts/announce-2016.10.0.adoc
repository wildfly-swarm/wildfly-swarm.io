== It's October, so that means it's time for candy corn. And a WildFly Swarm release!

October, which comes from the Latin of "octo" meaning 8, is obviously the 10th
month.  We can thank Julius and Augustus Caesar (July and August, respectively)
for giving us a persistent off-by-two error in how we count months.

Nonetheless, it's time for another WildFly Swarm release.  Enjoy!

=== What's New?

* External ActiveMQ/Artemis broker configuration is simplified.
* Better SAAJ support.
* Arquillian supporting Maven profiles.
* Service/Topology advertisements via API and annotations.
* Jolokia upgrade and support for `jolokia-access.xml`
* Much much more!

=== What is WildFly Swarm?

WildFly Swarm is the decomposition and reconstitution of the popular
http://www.wildfly.org[WildFly Java Application Server] in order to support _just enough appserver_
for microservice type applications.

Each portion of the appserver is referred to as a _fraction_, which many times
maps to a `subsystem` from WildFly, but also may include other discrete chunks
of non-Java EE or WIldFly functionality, such as _Swagger_, _Jolokia_ or _NetflixOSS Ribbon_.
