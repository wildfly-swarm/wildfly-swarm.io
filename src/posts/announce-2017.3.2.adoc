== WildFly Swarm 2017.3.2 is hot, just like the weather!

After a series of unfortunate weather events in which versions 2017.3.0 and 2017.3.1 met their
early demise, we're proud to announce version 2017.3.2.


=== What's New?

* Keycloak Updates
* Logging noise
* Auto Detection improvements

=== What is WildFly Swarm?

WildFly Swarm is the decomposition and reconstitution of the popular
http://www.wildfly.org[WildFly Java Application Server] in order to support _just enough appserver_
for microservice type applications.

Each portion of the appserver is referred to as a _fraction_, which many times
maps to a `subsystem` from WildFly, but also may include other discrete chunks
of non-Java EE or WildFly functionality, such as _Swagger_, or _Jolokia_.

== Keycloak Updates

We've got a few things related to Keycloak for this release.
The first is we've updated to 2.5.4.Final, bringing the latest bug fixes to you!

We've also introduced a Keycloak Client API for our fraction that allows
you to define the equivalent `keycloak.json` content in `project-defaults.yml`!
The big advantage to this is pulling out environment specific config from inside
a WAR and into an overridable config file.

Full details on what can be set is available https://reference.wildfly-swarm.io/v/2017.3.2/fractions/keycloak.html[here],
but here's a quick example of what you can do:

[source,yaml]
----
  swarm:
    keycloak:
      secure-deployments:
        my.war:
          realm: my-relam
          bearer-only: true
          auth-server-url: http://localhost:9090/auth
          ssl-required: external
          resource: my-service
----

== Logging noise

We've drastically reduced the amount of logging that spews forth by default on startup.

You can still see what was there by enabling `DEBUG` or higher logging,
but it's now hidden away unless you need it.

== Auto Detection improvements

We've altered how auto detection works which provides some significant benefits in how it works.

The biggest being that we're able to detect fractions based on usage in descriptor files!

For instance, we can now detect `jsf` if you don't use any JSF classes in your application,
but you define the `FacesServlet` in `web.xml`.

This feature will allow us to more easily improve what is auto detected in the future.
