== WildFly Swarm 2018.5.0

This _May_ be a good release, but you can be the judge of that!

=== What's New?

* Eclipse MicroProfile fixes and improvements
* Update fractions to match WildFly 11 configuration

== Eclipse MicroProfile fixes and improvements

* MicroProfile JWT
** It's now possible to load public keys from JWKS URI using the `swarm.microprofile.jwt.token.jwks-uri` config property
** It's now possible to specify a `file:` or `classpath:` reference to the public key in `swarm.microprofile.jwt.token.signer-pub-key` config property
** Configuration - roles properties file is now optional
** A JAX-RS resource with no `@RolesAllowed` annotation is now secured properly
** By default, if there is no class-level security annotation, an unconstrained resource method has always an implicit `@DenyAll`. It's now configurable through `swarm.microprofile.jwt.default-missing-method-permissions-deny-access` config property
* MicroProfile Fault Tolerance
** Support `@Asynchronous` `@CircuitBreaker` and `@Asynchronous` `@Retry` combinations
** Fraction configuration properties and limitations are now properly documented
* MicroProfile OpenAPI
** Endpoints that accept arrays and generic types are supported properly

== Update fractions to match WildFly 11 configuration

*WARNING: Breaking changes!*

In this release, we updated default configuration of various fractions to better match default `standalone-full.xml` configuration of WildFly 11.
As part of that, we made sure some more arcane Java EE features are accessible and easily usable.

The `ejb-remote` fraction, which is used to enable EJB remoting, now also enables remote naming and remote messaging.

Enabling stateful EJB passivation is now possible.
Note that, due to https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-10280[WFLY-10280], EJB passivation only works if `ejb-remote` is present.

The `infinispan` fraction no longer enables clustered setup when the `jgroups` fraction is present.
The Infinispan configuration is always local.
This is to make sure that we don't enable clustered setup when JGroups are brought in transitively, e.g. through the `messaging` fraction.
It has been the case for quite some time that WildFly Swarm intentionally doesn't support clustering, and this change is part of it.

Previously, queues and topics in messaging were automatically created on demand.
This is no longer the case.
You have to create queues and topics explicitly in `project-defaults.yml`, or enable on-demand creation.
On-demand queues/topics creation was an unintentional consequence of a seemingly innocent configuration difference.
For more information, see the explanation in https://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-examples/pull/180[this pull request].

Default configuration of the Elytron subsystem is now much closer to WildFly's.
Elytron is the new security subsystem in WildFly, but it hasn't received much attention in WildFly Swarm yet.
