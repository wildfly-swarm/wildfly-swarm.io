= Step 2: Right-size your runtime

= Step 2: Right-size your runtime

In this activity we bring Swarm to the table. We look the basic concepts for building Swarm services and discover how to build and run it. This includes basic configuration options, like bind address, ports and logging.

In the previous step all services have been deployed to a single JVM (WildFly). Now we separate the `order`, `catalog` and `user` services and run each in their own JVM (could be thought of as another  another host).

== Concepts
* Swarm plugin
* Uberjar
* Fraction auto discovery

== Tasks
* Add a dependency to the Swarm BOM  to the top level pom.xml, so all modules inherit the Swarm dependencies if needed.
 This includes the Swarm maven plugin.
* Prepare each service module (pom.xml) to include the Swarm maven plugin (i.e. `order`, `user`, `catalog`)
* Do a top level build (`mvn clean install`). This will create the `-swarm.jar` artifacts in all modules that youâ€™ve added the Swarm plugin.
* Run each service from the command-line `java -jar <service-name>-swarm.jar -Dswarm.bind.address=<PUBLIC_IP> -Dswarm.port.offset=<PORT_OFFSET>`

NOTE: Make sure you explicitly bind the services to `<PUBLIC_IP>`, i.e.:
`java -jar <service-name>-swarm.jar -Dswarm.bind.address=<PUBLIC_IP> -Dswarm.port.offset=<PORT_OFFSET>`

== Outcome
* Swarm packages the required runtime components and your service into a distinct .jar file
* You can each run service separately, without deploying it on WildFly.
* The user interface, remaining on WildFly, still works as expected.

== Alternative activities
* `mvn -Dswarm.bind.address=<PUBLIC_IP> wildfly-swarm:run`
* Inspect the build process or resulting jar to see what things get packaged
