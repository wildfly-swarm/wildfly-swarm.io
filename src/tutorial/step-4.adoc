= Step 4: Environment specific configuration

= Step 4: Environment specific configuration

Now that you know about fractions and ways to explicitly configure Swarm, it's a good to revisit the configuration options. We are already using a large number of system properties (i.e. bind address, port, etc) and some configuration values are hard coded within your custom `Main()` (i.e. service names, log level, etc). Let's move all this into a separate file to make it more manageable.

In Swarm we use project stages (`project-stages.yml`) to differentiate
between environments (i.e consul URL, etc) and to capture configuration values that change when moving from one environment to the next (i.e. from local development > continuous integration > production)

These configurations can then easily be switched by using the system property `-Dswarm.project.stage=<STAGE_NAME>`

Here's an example for service “user”

[project-stages.yml]
```
service:
   user:
       service-name: "user-SNAPSHOT"
swarm:
   port:
       offset: 0
   consul:
       url: "http://<CONSUL_IP>:8500"
---
project:
   stage: <STAGE_NAME>
service:
   user:
       service-name: "user"
swarm:
   port:
       offset: 50
   consul:
       url: "http://<CONSUL_IP>:8500"
```

== Concepts
* Environment specific changes: configuration: `project-stages.yml`
* Continuous delivery (in a wider context)

== Tasks
* Add a `project-stages.yml` to your sources (`src/main/resources`)
* Use it to configure the service-name, port and consul-url
* Make it to properly set the `<CONSUL_IP>` for property `swarm.consul.url`
* Introduce a default stage and one called “production”
* Remove any remaining configuration from the Swarm plugin

== Outcome
* You can run each service using different configurations, i.e.
`java -Dswarm.project.stage=<STAGE_NAME> -jar target/order-swarm.jar`
* The service name in `project-stages.yml` allows you to easily advertise a service that’s currently in development (i.e. for testing. Canary, A/B)
